$Module vsthrottle 3 Throttling VMOD
DESCRIPTION
===========

A Varnish vmod for rate-limiting traffic on a single Varnish
server. Offers a simple interface for throttling traffic on a per-key
basis to a specific request rate.

Keys can be specified from any VCL string, e.g. based on client.ip, a
specific cookie value, an API token, etc.

The request rate is specified as the number of requests permitted over
a period. To keep things simple, this is passed as two separate
parameters, 'limit' and 'period'.

This VMOD implements a `token-bucket algorithm`_. State associated
with the token bucket for each key is stored in-memory using BSD's
red-black tree implementation.

Memory usage is around 100 bytes per key tracked.

Example::

    vcl 4.0;
    import vsthrottle;

    backend default { .host = "192.0.2.11"; .port = "8080"; }

    sub vcl_recv {
        # Varnish will set client.identity for you based on client IP.

        if (vsthrottle.is_denied(client.identity, 15, 10s)) {
            # Client has exceeded 15 reqs per 10s
            return (synth(429, "Too Many Requests"));
        }

        # There is a quota per API key that must be fulfilled.
        if (vsthrottle.is_denied("apikey:" + req.http.Key, 30, 60s)) {
                return (synth(429, "Too Many Requests"));
        }

        # Only allow a few POST/PUTs per client.
        if (req.method == "POST" || req.method == "PUT") {
            if (vsthrottle.is_denied("rw" + client.identity, 2, 10s)) {
                return (synth(429, "Too Many Requests"));
            }
        }
    }

$Event event_function

$Function BOOL is_denied(STRING key, INT limit, DURATION period)

Arguments
    key: A unique identifier to define what is being throttled - more examples below
    limit: How many requests in the specified period
    period: The time period

Description
	Can be used to rate limit the traffic for a specific key to a
	maximum of 'limit' requests per 'period' time. A token bucket
	is uniquely identified by the triplet of its key, limit and
	period, so using the same key multiple places with different
	rules will create multiple token buckets.

Example
        ::

		sub vcl_recv {
			if (vsthrottle.is_denied(client.identity, 15, 10s)) {
				# Client has exceeded 15 reqs per 10s
				return (synth(429, "Too Many Requests"));
			}

			# ...
		}
