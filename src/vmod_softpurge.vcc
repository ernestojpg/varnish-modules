$Module softpurge Soft purge vmod
DESCRIPTION
===========

``Softpurge`` is cache invalidation in Varnish that reduces TTL but
keeps the grace value of a resource.

This makes it possible to serve stale content to users if the backend
is unavailable and fresh content can not be fetched.

$Function VOID softpurge()
Description
	Performs a soft purge. Valid in vcl_hit and vcl_miss.

Example::

	sub vcl_hit {
	    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
	        softpurge.softpurge();
	    }
	}

USAGE
=====
In your VCL you could then use this vmod along the following lines::

    import softpurge;

    sub vcl_recv {
        if (req.method == "PURGE") {
            return (hash);
        }
    }

    sub vcl_backend_response {
        set beresp.grace = 10m;
    }

    sub vcl_hit {
        if (req.method == "PURGE") {
            softpurge.softpurge();
            return (synth(200, "Successful softpurge"));
        }
    }

    sub vcl_miss {
        if (req.method == "PURGE") {
            softpurge.softpurge();
            return (synth(200, "Successful softpurge"));
        }
    }
