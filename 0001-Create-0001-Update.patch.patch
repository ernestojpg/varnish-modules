++Status of this repository
++=========================
++
++Modules in this repository are generally not in active development by
++Varnish Software. However, any security related bugs and issues will
++always be a high priority, and in some cases we will accept new
++features to the VMODs
++
++For Varnish Software, the maintainer of this repository, the VMODs are
++categorized as follows.
++
++VMODs under development
++-----------------------
++
++The VMODs in this category are ``tcp`` and ``vsthrottle``.
++
++New features for these VMODs will be considered on a case-by-case
++basis, and new features will be accepted if they fit together with
++existing features in VMOD.
++
++Feature complete VMODs
++----------------------
++
++The VMODs in this category are ``Cookie``, ``xkey``, ``saintmode``,
++``softpurge``, ``bodyaccess``, ``header`` and ``var``.
++
++This software in this repository is considered feature complete and we
++do no longer accept contributions that introduce new features. The
++software is maintained with security and bug fixes, and contributions
++related to this will be accepted.
++
++Deprecated VMODs
++----------------
++
++There are no VMODs in this category.
++
++This software has been deprecated and is no longer maintained.
++Contributions will not be accepted.
++
++
++Moved or replaced VMODs
++-----------------------
++
++VMODs in this category are no longer maintained because their
++functionality is covered by other functionality or newer VMODs.
++
++In this repository there is only one such vmod:
++
++* ``softpurge`` is now replaced by the ``purge`` VMOD in Varnish.
++  Note that this VMOD is also in the "feature complete" category,
++  since it is still needed for Varnish Cache 4.1.
++
++General note
++------------
++
++If you want to contribute a feature for this software, please create
++an issue and describe your implementation plans before you get
++started. This allows us to verify that the contribution is in line
++with the software's roadmap.
++
++Future compatibility
++--------------------
++
++Varnish has no commitment to update this software to be compatible
++with future versions of Varnish Cache. At the same time, the license
++of the sotware allows anyone to improve the product in any way, for
++example by making it compatible with future versions of Varnish Cache.
